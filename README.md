# Linked List
- It is a dynamic data strcuture similar to an array **but** each element (node) is links to the next like a chain DS.
- To initialize this we need:

1. Linked List class
2. Node class => complex data strcuture with 2 instant methods (data, next_node)
- *next_node* => has data of the next node it links to
- *data* => data of the node itself
